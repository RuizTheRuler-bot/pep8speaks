# :wave: Hi!
I'm a bot created to help you fix the syntax and style errors in your programming assignments. I'll scan your code each time you submit (and re-submit) your program and create a list of necessary corrections.

My friend **GitHub Action Bot** will also be commenting here. He will notify you of any logic, formatting, or runtime errors in your program. Those will be a little harder to find, but he'll point you in the right direction.

You may want to watch this [video](https://youtu.be/gdc-SYhRFCM) our creator made. It demonstrates how we'll help you fix all the errors in your programming assignment.

## :pencil: To-do List:
- [ ] Open both ```repl.it``` and this Feedback conversation side-by-side on your computer.
- [ ] Read our bot comments here, and make a few small changes to your program in ```repl.it```.
- [ ] After each small change you make, resubmit your file from ```repl.it```.
- [ ] Wait for both bots to scan your new code. 
- [ ] We'll make new comments directing you to fix more errors, -or- letting you know your program is free from errors.

# :wave: Hi!
Each time you submit your program, It will be scanned by me and my friend **GitHub Action Bot**. I will help you find and fix syntax and style errors, and he will help you find and fix logic, formatting, or runtime errors.

## Debugging Directions
It will be easiest to debug your program if you have both replit and this conversation opened side-by-side on your computer.

Read our comments, update and resubmit your code in replit, then wait for us to scan your submission. Repeat this process until we tell you your program has no errors.

This [video](https://youtu.be/gdc-SYhRFCM) demonstrates how we can help you debug your program.
