# :wave: Hi!
I'm a bot created to help you fix the syntax and style errors in your programming assignments. I'll scan your code each time you submit (and re-submit) your program and create a list of necessary corrections.

My friend **GitHub Action Bot** will also be commenting here. He will notify you of any logic, formatting, or runtime errors in your program. Those will be a little harder to find, but he'll point you in the right direction.

You may want to watch this [video](https://youtu.be/gdc-SYhRFCM) our creator made. It demonstrates how we'll help you fix all the errors in your programming assignment.

## :pencil: To-do List:
- [ ] Open both ```repl.it``` and this Feedback conversation side-by-side on your computer.
- [ ] Read our bot comments here, and make a few small changes to your program in ```repl.it```.
- [ ] After each small change you make, resubmit your file from ```repl.it```.
- [ ] Wait for both bots to scan your new code. 
- [ ] We'll make new comments directing you to fix more errors, -or- letting you know your program is free from errors.
