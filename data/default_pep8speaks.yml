I'll scan your code each time you submit (and re-submit) it. Once all the syntax and style errors have been corrected, then we'll move on to **part 2** of the debugging process, checking for logic, formatting, and runtime errors.\n\n> If your program contains any syntax or style errors, I'll list them below.  Each error will include a line number, and what the error is exactly.\n\n## :pencil: To-do List:\n - [ ] Fix each error outlined below. (It may be helpful to have both this page and your program open on replit)\n- [ ] Commit/push your updated program.\n- [ ] Re-open or refresh this pull request to see if I found any more syntax or style errors that need to be fixed.\n\n## :question: What happens next?\nThis is only the first part of the debugging process. Once all syntax and style errors have been corrected, your program will be scanned for logic, formatting, and runtime errors."
