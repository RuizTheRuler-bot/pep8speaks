I'll scan your code each time you submit (and re-submit) it. \n>\n> If your program contains any syntax or style errors, I'll list them below.  Each error will include a line number, and what the error is exactly.\n\n## :pencil: To-do List:\n - [ ] In repl.it, fix each error outlined below. \n- [ ] Commit/push your updated program.\n- [ ] In the same repl.it menu you used to commit your submission, there is a link back to this assignment repo (it's right under the "Version Control" header). \n- [ ] Re-open or refresh this pull request to see if I found any more syntax or style errors that need to be fixed.\n- [ ] Complete this process until I tell you all syntax and style errors have been fixed.\n## :clipboard: List of errors to correct:"
        footer: "## :question: What happens next?\nThis is only the first part of the debugging process. Once you have corrected all the syntax and style errors, your program will be scanned for logic, formatting, and runtime errors. Those errors will cause an **ISSUE** to be created (in the issue tab above). That process is a bit different, I'll have instructions for you there."
