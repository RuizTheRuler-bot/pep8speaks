I'll scan your code each time you submit (and re-submit) your program. \n>\n> If your program contains any syntax or style errors, I'll list them below.  Each error will include a line number, and what the error is exactly.\n\n## :pencil: To-do List:\n - [ ] In repl.it, fix each error outlined below. *(it may be helpful to have both this page and repl.it open)* \n- [ ] Commit/push your updated program in repl.it.\n- [ ] Navigate back to this GitHub pull request. \n\t- *(In the same repl.it menu you use to commit your submission, there is a link back to this repo. It's under the **Version Control** header). \n- [ ] Re-open or refresh this pull request to see if I found any more syntax or style errors that need to be fixed.\n- [ ] Complete this process until I tell you all syntax and style errors have been fixed.\n## :clipboard: List of errors to correct:"

Once you have corrected all the syntax and style errors, your program will be scanned for logic, formatting, and runtime errors. Those errors will cause an **ISSUE** to be created (in the issue tab above). That process is a bit different, I'll have instructions for you there."
    no_errors: "# :tada: Congratulations!!\nYou've fixed all the syntax and style errors in your code.\n## :question: What happens next?\nNow, your code will be scanned for logic, formatting, and runtime errors:\n- Once your last submission has finished processing, open the **ISSUES** tab above.\n- Open the **Test Failure** issue, and there will be further instructions there.\n- If there are no issues, then you are finished! Great work!
